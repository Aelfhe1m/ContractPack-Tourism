    title = Tourism: @/SpawnPassengers/count.Print() tourists to visit @targetVessel
    description = Some tourists would like to visit @targetVessel on @targetBody.  This trip will cost them a lot.
    synopsis = Bring @/SpawnPassengers/count.Print() tourists to visit the base.
    completedMessage = The tourists had a great time!

    // Level 3 prestige
    prestige = Exceptional

    // Increase the weight based on the number of moons

    notes = Don't forget that tourists cannot EVA!  This means that we'll need a suitable way of getting them on the base (like a docking port).
